## Overview of Project: 

Customize UFO Sightings webpage using Bootstrap, and equip UFO table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Analysis of UFO sightings will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Filter searching criteria included date, city, state, country, and shape. We used data stored in a JavaScript array to built UFO table and place the table into a HTMLS file for easy viewing.


## Results: 

> ### ***1. When the user access to the UFO webpage will see the UFO's header, article and table with the date, city, state, country, and shape as a search criteria***

>### ***2.Â Users can narrow or customize table search by inputting the type of result they want in the filter search placeholders under date, city, state, country, and shape. Looking the example below we can see that user filtered the table by entering the following criteria ;***
```
- el cajon under City 
- ca under Stater
- us under Country 
- light under Shape
User must press enter after typing the last search criteria
```
>***The result of this search criteria brought back two row who matched the user current search criteria***
