## Overview of Project: 

Customize UFO Sightings webpage using Bootstrap, and equip UFO table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. Analysis of UFO sightings will allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Filter searching criteria included date, city, state, country, and shape. We used data stored in a JavaScript array to built UFO table and place the table into a HTMLS file for easy viewing.




## Results: 

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.






## Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
